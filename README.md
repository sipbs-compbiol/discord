# SIPBSCompBiol `discord` server

This repository is for files related to the SIPBSCompBiol `discord` server: snippets of code for discussion, tools, information, images, that sort of thing.

## What's on the `discord` server?

Chat channels for:

- `python`
- `R`
- `shell`
- `git`
- The Carpentries
- `rosalind`
- special events and announcements

and **live voice chat** (woo!).

## Where is it?

It's [here](https://discordapp.com/channels/689490242755100808/689507570238488590) but you won't see it unless you have an invitation and a `discord` account.

## How do I get an invitation?

The `discord` server for `sipbs-compbiol` is private, and invitation-only. If you're in SIPBS, or SIPBS-related, and you'd like to join in the chat, reply to this thread and one of the admins will sort you out.

Head over to the [`issue`](https://github.com/sipbs-compbiol/discord/issues/1) and request an invitation. After a very brief check to see if you're who you say you are (an admin might pop their head round the door or something), you'll get an invitation.

## How do I use this repository?

We'll work it out as we go, but for now maybe make a directory with a sensible (unique) name and put the files in there?
